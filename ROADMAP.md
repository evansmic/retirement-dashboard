# ROADMAP.md

## Direction

The product is a consumer-first, local-first Canadian retirement planner. The default experience should become recommended-plan-first: one clear household plan, with stress tests and alternatives as supporting diagnostics rather than equal competing tabs.

The strategic direction is now sharper: build the **Canadian retirement decision engine**. Compared with broad tools like ProjectionLab, this product should win by being narrower, more Canada-specific, more explainable, and more decision-oriented.

Reference direction doc: [`docs/canadian_retirement_decision_engine.md`](docs/canadian_retirement_decision_engine.md).

Accounts remain optional infrastructure for sync, license recovery, sharing, advisor collaboration, or multi-device continuity. Core planning, local save/load, import/export, anonymous trial, and local paid unlock where feasible should remain accountless.

## Completed Milestones

### Engine And Modelling

- **Phase 1 — Core engine correctness.** Pre-65 RRSP draws, taxable-income target solver, capital gains on non-registered draws, OAS clawback after pension split, and zero-shortfall verification.
- **Phase 2 — Canadian household rules.** Survivor rollover, joint non-registered ownership, annual taxable distributions, unified indexation, BPA phase-out, Ontario Health Premium, LIF max draws, mortgage payoff, and LOC amortisation.
- **Phase 3 — Strategy and UX.** Per-year withdrawal-order overrides, cash wedge, younger-spouse RRIF election, spousal-RRSP attribution, CPP sharing, principal residence/downsize events, one-offs, bequest lines, real/nominal toggle, and shortfall/depletion KPIs.
- **Phase 4 — Stress testing and reporting.** Monte Carlo, historical sequence stress, full-spending-funded metric, PDF/print export, and FP Canada guideline defaults.
- **Phase 5 — Working couples.** Per-spouse retirement years, salary/raises/contributions, dual DB pensions, and working-year UI output.

## Active Next Step

Sprint 26 is complete. Suggested Sprint 27 should focus on **Scenario Choice Redesign**.

Goal: make scenario comparison feel like household decision-making rather than model diagnostics.

Candidate Sprint 27 slices:

- Reframe scenario cards as household choices: keep current plan, spend more/less early, work longer, delay benefits, and review estate trade-off.
- Add "best for" and "trade-off" language to help households understand why a path may fit their goals.
- Reduce technical deltas on first-read cards while preserving full comparison detail in the supporting table.
- Keep current scenario rerun boundaries and avoid custom scenario builder scope.
- Preserve schema v2, stable dashboard parity, and runtime-only recommendation output.

## Consumer Roadmap Sequence

Near-term product work should prioritize interpretation and journey simplification before adding more modelling surface:

1. **Sprint 23 — Consumer results simplification.** Hide advanced diagnostics behind a Details path while keeping them available for deeper review.
2. **Sprint 24 — Spending capacity layer.** Answer "How much can I spend?" and identify underspending, balanced spending, tight plans, and repair amounts.
3. **Sprint 25 — Estate intent and tax efficiency.** Make estate wishes explicit and connect projected estate, registered assets, OAS clawback, giving, and later-life tax to household choices.
4. **Sprint 26 — Intake UX and help text.** Add plain guidance for CPP/OAS, DB bridge pensions, LIRA/LIF, ACB, real estate, survivor assumptions, and estate goals.
5. **Sprint 27 — Scenario choice redesign.** Reframe scenario cards as household choices with "best for" language and fewer technical deltas.
6. **Sprint 28+ — Optimizer prep and optimizer.** Build spending, retirement timing, CPP/OAS timing, withdrawal order, tax-aware drawdown, estate target, and downsizing optimization after the answer model is clear.

## Medium-Term Roadmap

- **Sprint 7 — Results clarity and decision readiness.** Turn migrated result panels into a decision layer: plan health, source reconciliation story, review checklist, tax pressure, first scenario cards, and survivor view.
- **Sprint 8 — Recommended plan pathway v0.** Select the strongest preview candidate from the current plan and three local reruns, explain why it was selected, show why alternatives did not overtake it, and keep the result runtime-only.
- **Sprint 9 — Recommended path stress and confidence.** Add a bounded confidence selector, selected-path stress context, break-risk panel, and stable dashboard detail handoff while staying runtime-only.
- **Sprint 10 — Recommended path detail drilldowns.** Make break risks selectable and show focused selected-path evidence while preserving stable dashboard detail ownership.
- **Sprint 11 — Recommended path implementation checklist.** Convert confidence, stress, and drilldown evidence into a runtime-only review checklist before users rely on the preview path.
- **Sprint 12 — React annual detail parity.** Add a first-class Annual Detail tab with full year-by-year React rows and simple view controls.
- **Sprint 13 — React results chart parity.** Add bounded chart-ready visuals for portfolio, spending/tax/shortfall, and account bucket balances without adding export/reporting scope.
- **Sprint 14 — React results polish and handoff audit.** Tighten Results workspace spacing, chart/table readability, and stable-dashboard handoff copy before adding more feature surface.
- **Sprint 15 — Entry point and handoff reliability.** Make React preview, stable intake, stable dashboard, and Vercel preview routes explicit and regression-tested.
- **Sprint 16 — React stress tests parity.** Deepen the Stress Tests tab with runtime-only baseline stress summary, evidence rows, review actions, and stable-dashboard handoff.
- **Sprint 17 — React tax detail parity.** Complete 2026-05-08. Deepened the Taxes tab with runtime-only tax story, review rows, and stable-dashboard audit handoff.
- **Sprint 18 — React account detail / drawdown parity.** Complete 2026-05-08. Made account balance and withdrawal movement easier to review in React without adding export/reporting or persisted UI state.
- **Sprint 19 — React survivor detail parity.** Complete 2026-05-14. Deepened Household Resilience with survivor story, comparison rows, and review handoffs while keeping full audit views in the stable dashboard.
- **Sprint 20 — React results readiness and save handoff polish.** Complete 2026-05-14. Added runtime-only final readiness rows and clearer Export/Save handoff without persisting result state.
- **Sprint 21 — Engine extraction scenario and survivor runner.** Complete 2026-05-14. Moved Results preview baseline, scenario, and survivor reruns behind an engine-owned runtime helper.
- **Sprint 22 — Consumer retirement answer layer.** Complete 2026-05-14. Added a first Results answer for retirement readiness, spending fit, estate intent, and next review actions while softening estate-heavy recommendations.
- **Sprint 23 — Consumer results simplification.** Complete 2026-05-14. Consolidated advanced diagnostic result pages behind a Details hub so the top-level Results journey stays consumer-focused.
- **Sprint 24 — Spending capacity layer.** Complete 2026-05-15. Added a first-pass spending capacity answer for flexible, balanced, tight, and repair-needed plans using existing scenario output.
- **Sprint 25 — Estate intent and tax efficiency.** Complete 2026-05-15. Added a first-pass estate/tax-efficiency review connecting projected estate, estate goals, OAS recovery tax, final registered assets, and survivor review prompts.
- **Sprint 26 — Intake UX and help text.** Complete 2026-05-15. Reframed guided intake language around household planning choices and added plain help for CPP/OAS, DB bridges, locked-in accounts, ACB, real estate/downsize, survivor assumptions, and estate goals.
- **Engine extraction continuation.** Continue extracting simulation and stress modules so future scenario cards and the optimizer can run against explicit plan objects instead of global `D`.
- **Recommended-plan optimizer.** Build only after the decision-readiness layer is clear. First optimizer pass should cover CPP/OAS timing, withdrawal order, pension split/share settings, meltdown/guardrail strategy, and estate trade-offs.
- **Phase 7 — Provinces.** Abstract Ontario-specific tax behind a province selector. BC and Alberta first; Quebec is larger scope due to QPP and distinct tax rules.
- **Phase 8 — Paid local-first capabilities.** Local license unlocks, Plus reports, implementation packages, richer diagnostics, and extra provinces while keeping accounts optional.
- **Phase 8b — Optimized plan and implementation guidance.** Present one recommended household plan, then generate account-by-account drawdown instructions, tax/benefit checkpoints, RRIF/LIF notes, CPP/OAS timing, and guardrail thresholds.
- **Phase 9 — Advisor mode.** Multi-household workspace, client-ready reports, white-label branding, collaboration, and optional encrypted sync. Build only after the consumer workflow is stable.

## Future Ideas
